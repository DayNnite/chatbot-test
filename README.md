📦 Widget Gateway
This project hosts a gateway script that loads a third-party widget (testmyprompt.com/widget.js) through your own domain.

🚀 How It Works
Clients embed your hosted gateway.js script on their website.

gateway.js automatically loads the real widget for them.

You stay in control and can update or block access in the future if needed.
